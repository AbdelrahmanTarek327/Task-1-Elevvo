# Task-1-Elevvo
# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning


## ðŸ“œ Abstract
This project explores the use of **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** models to predict student performance based on various academic and socio-economic features.  
The goal is to evaluate how different regression techniques model the relationship between study-related factors and student scores.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)
- **Size:** [6607 rows/20 columns]
- **Description:** Includes student demographics, parental education levels, study time, and exam scores.

## ðŸ§  Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing feature distributions  
   - Correlation heatmaps  

3. **Model Development**  
   - **Linear Regression** for baseline  
   - **Polynomial Regression** for capturing nonlinear patterns  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Coefficient of Determination \( R^2 \)  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## ðŸ“Š Results
| Model                | RÂ² Score |
|----------------------|----------|
| Linear Regression    | 0.760    |
| Polynomial Regression| 0.752    |

> Linear Regression slightly outperformed Polynomial Regression in this dataset.
